# 🌍 About Cacao Gold
💻 Cacao Gold | Cacao EcoFarming On Solana As A Socio-Climate Impact Enterprise 

With DePIN technology, Cacao Gold converts cacao ecofarming as an RWA on an 800-hectare land allocated by the Philippine government in a public-private partnership to combat the global cacao supply crisis and mitigate climate change.

Cacao Gold is a blueprint for how blockchain technology can transform industries with significant socio-climate impacts. By merging decentralized finance, real-world asset tokenization, and sustainable agriculture, it creates a scalable, transparent model for ecological and social empowerment.

This project not only preserves indigenous knowledge and ecosystems but also introduces a groundbreaking economic system where profit, conservation, and community are seamlessly integrated.
